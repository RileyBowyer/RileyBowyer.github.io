# Different Training Methods for fastai and Various Metrics

## Different Training Methods
With Q3 of the assignment in full swing, I took the time to investigate the different standard methods of training used in fastai. 

The simplest way is simply fine tuning a pretrained model. Thanks to the abstraction of fastai, this is performed with minimal effort as follows,

```python
learn = fva.cnn_learner(dls, <model>, pretrained=True, metrics=[<metrics>])
learn.fine_tune(<epochs>)
```

Alternatively, the optimal learning rate can be identified and modified during training. This allows for a bit more insight into the training process and adapts the model accordingly.

```python
learn = fva.cnn_learner(dls, <model>, pretrained=True, metrics=[<metrics>])
lrs = learn.lr_find(suggest_funcs=(fva.minimum, fva.steep, fva.valley, fva.slide))
learn.fit_one_cycle(3,lrs.valley)
learn.unfreeze()
lrs = learn.lr_find(suggest_funcs=(fva.minimum, fva.steep, fva.valley, fva.slide))
learn.fit_one_cycle(10,slice(lrs.minimum,lrs.slide))
```

## Different Metrics for fastai

After training a few models, a minor investigation into the impact of different metrics in the training process was conducted. A full list of metrics is presented by fastai [here](https://docs.fast.ai/metrics.html#single-label-classification). For the purpose of the assignment, the following code was used to conduct an analysis,

```python
metric_comp = (
  [fva.accuracy, fva.error_rate],
  [fva.F1Score()],
  [fva.F1Score(), fva.Precision(), fva.Recall()],
)

fva.cnn_learner(dls, fva.resnet50, pretrained=True, metrics=[fva.accuracy])

models = []
interps = []

for metrics in metric_comp:
  print(f"Training with metrics: {metrics}")
  models.append(fva.cnn_learner(dls, fva.resnet50, pretrained=True, metrics=metrics))
  models[-1].fine_tune(5)
  interps.append(fva.ClassificationInterpretation.from_learner(models[-1]))
  interps[-1].plot_confusion_matrix(figsize=(5,5), dpi=120)
```
