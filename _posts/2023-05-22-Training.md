# Different Training Methods for fastai

With Q3 of the assignment in full swing, I took the time to investigate the different standard methods of training used in fastai. 

The simplest way is simply fine tuning a pretrained model. Thanks to the abstraction of fastai, this is performed with minimal effort as follows,

```python
learn = fva.cnn_learner(dls, <model>, pretrained=True, metrics=[<metrics>])
learn.fine_tune(<epochs>)
```

Alternatively, the optimal learning rate can be identified and modified during training. This allows for a bit more insight into the training process and adapts the model accordingly.

```python
learn = fva.cnn_learner(dls, <model>, pretrained=True, metrics=[<metrics>])
lrs = learn.lr_find(suggest_funcs=(fva.minimum, fva.steep, fva.valley, fva.slide))
learn.fit_one_cycle(3,lrs.valley)
learn.unfreeze()
lrs = learn.lr_find(suggest_funcs=(fva.minimum, fva.steep, fva.valley, fva.slide))
learn.fit_one_cycle(10,slice(lrs.minimum,lrs.slide))
```
