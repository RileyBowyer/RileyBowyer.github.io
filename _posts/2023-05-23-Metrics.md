# Different Metrics for fastai

After training a few models, a minor investigation into the impact of different metrics in the training process was conducted. A full list of metrics is presented by fastai [here](https://docs.fast.ai/metrics.html#single-label-classification). For the purpose of the assignment, the following code was used to conduct an analysis,

```python
metric_comp = (
  [fva.accuracy, fva.error_rate],
  [fva.F1Score()],
  [fva.F1Score(), fva.Precision(), fva.Recall()],
)

fva.cnn_learner(dls, fva.resnet50, pretrained=True, metrics=[fva.accuracy])

models = []
interps = []

for metrics in metric_comp:
  print(f"Training with metrics: {metrics}")
  models.append(fva.cnn_learner(dls, fva.resnet50, pretrained=True, metrics=metrics))
  models[-1].fine_tune(5)
  interps.append(fva.ClassificationInterpretation.from_learner(models[-1]))
  interps[-1].plot_confusion_matrix(figsize=(5,5), dpi=120)
```
